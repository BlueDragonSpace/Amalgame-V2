Focus on the design of the game first, then lore, art, music, particle effects to look good...
Should be fun with nothing put on top of it

There's not going to be a floor... floating in the sky... (also to balance out Overhead view)

Need:
	what

Probably:
	Camera limits (why is it looking at the floor?)
		Camera lerping (also implemented by Phantom Camera)
		Camera no-move box (implemented by Phantom Camera)
	UI Camera shifting bar + Timer (Camera Symbols)
	White World (scenes)
	Blocks only collide if the player can see the actual block
		(either raycast to whatever blocks the camera, or use a visual checker)

Maybe:
	Stop the player (everything) when moving
	Orthogonal art intent (2D presumably) (as in like figuring out how to work with the camera)

Want:
	Jump Particles
	Screenshake (implement to use later)
	Pixel Perfect Camera (Celeste guy tutorial)

Ehhhhhh Don't really care about anymore:
	Shadows! For the player to sense where they are 

Note that these are all listed in order of importance (like a tier list! cuz it is a tier list)

If you ever do use the mirror, it should probably be a reflective surface rather than a static camera lol
Phantom Camera can't handle Orthographic perspective

SCENES:
	Third-Person! (just move the camera outwards lol)

BUGS:
	Standing next to fez block puts you on top of it on camera change - when the hitboxes expand
	WHY IS THE HITBOX POSITION AND SIZE CHANGING (the mesh and collider aren't) - might be able to get away with it, for now

REFACTORING:
	Player3D Camera type enum automatically finds Camera names
