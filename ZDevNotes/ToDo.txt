Need:
	GitHub (obviously)
	White World (scenes)

Probably:
	Pixel Perfect Camera (Celeste guy tutorial)

Maybe:
	Drunken Camera Offset

Want:
	

Note that these are all listed in order of importance (like a tier list! cuz it is a tier list)

If you ever do use the mirror, it should probably be a reflective surface rather than a static camera lol

SCENES:
	Third-Person! (just move the camera outwards lol)

REFACTORING:
	Player3D Camera type enum automatically finds Camera names
