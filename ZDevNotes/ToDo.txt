Focus on the design of the game first, then lore, art, music, particle effects to look good...
Should be fun with nothing put on top of it

Need:
	Y-AXIS FLATTENING woah

Probably:
	Stop the player (everything) when moving
	Camera limits (why is it looking at the floor?)
		Camera lerping
		Camera no-move box (implemented by Phantom Camera)
	UI Camera shifting bar + Timer (Camera Symbols)
	White World (scenes)
	Shadows! For the player to sense where they are

Maybe:
	Drunken Camera Offset
	Orthogonal art intent (2D presumably) (as in like figuring out how to work with the camera)

Want:
	Jump Particles
	Screenshake (implement to use later)
	Pixel Perfect Camera (Celeste guy tutorial)

Note that these are all listed in order of importance (like a tier list! cuz it is a tier list)

If you ever do use the mirror, it should probably be a reflective surface rather than a static camera lol

SCENES:
	Third-Person! (just move the camera outwards lol)

BUGS:
	Standing next to fez block puts you on top of it on camera change - when the hitboxes expand
	WHY IS THE HITBOX POSITION AND SIZE CHANGING (the mesh and collider aren't) - might be able to get away with it, for now

REFACTORING:
	Player3D Camera type enum automatically finds Camera names
