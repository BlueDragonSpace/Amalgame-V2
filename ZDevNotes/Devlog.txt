So many ways to make a large system like this go wrong...
I can keep making projects though!

Amalgame. Cascade was originally named Amalgame, so this is V2

Figured out bookmarks!
Displaying 2D images on a 3D scene (viewports)

Set up Github, a really bad fake mirror, tab and arrow UI stuff, and so many cameras
Trying to link up the cameras with an inbetween camera, but something's still missing...

Had an insight: I don't think the 3D camera is going to work... Even when the projection is orthogonal,
it's gonna have unintended 3D blocked shadows and other stuff...
I think I might have to make something like Fez's game engine, the way 2D is interacting with 3D is similar

Figured out why the transition camera isn't working: It's curving to the PathFollow3D, have to set manually
Fixed the CAMERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Made One-way Platforms, likely a must for what comes next

Current Devlog:
	Made the camera smoothly transition from one viewpoint to another! 
	
	This took me wayyy longer than I thought, had to figure out how to use lerp() and animations and that the PathFollow2D I was using was rotating the camera the wrong way and blehhhh
	I'm really happy with how this turned out in the end tho
	
	I realized that the game I'm making could be comparable to FEZ, but instead of a puzzler and from a head-on view in four directions, mine is trying to manipulate other viewpoints, like bird's eye and first person...
	
	And I made a weird mirror using a camera instead of a reflective material lol
	
	(unfortunately I don't think the hours tracked, because I was offline)
	Orthogonal testing... Makes sense for this game...
	In Fez, there were four directions to go. Now you should be able to view from above as well...
