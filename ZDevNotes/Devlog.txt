So many ways to make a large system like this go wrong...
I can keep making projects though!

Amalgame. Cascade was originally named Amalgame, so this is V2

Figured out bookmarks!
Displaying 2D images on a 3D scene (viewports)

(12/11)
Set up Github, a really bad fake mirror, tab and arrow UI stuff, and so many cameras
Trying to link up the cameras with an inbetween camera, but something's still missing...

(12/12)
Had an insight: I don't think the 3D camera is going to work... Even when the projection is orthogonal,
it's gonna have unintended 3D blocked shadows and other stuff...
I think I might have to make something like Fez's game engine, the way 2D is interacting with 3D is similar

Figured out why the transition camera isn't working: It's curving to the PathFollow3D, have to set manually
Fixed the CAMERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

(12/13)
Made One-way Platforms, likely a must for what comes next
Made Fez Blocks!
Also figured out enums (forgot to put it in the Devlog)

(12/14)
Made the Fez Blocks teleport the player to the block's position (like in Fez!)
Added Y-axis stuff (unlike Fez!)
